## Toggling
{% capture text-capture %}

```html
<div class="demo-thats-all-container">  
    <div class="demo-thats-all-folks">
      That's All Folks
    </div>
</div>
```

{% endcapture %}

{% include toggle-field.html toggle-name="toggle-thats" button-text="View Answer" toggle-text=text-capture  footer="cheers!" %}

## Special formatting

As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:

+ ~~strike through~~
+ ==highlight==
+ \*escaped characters\*

This is a code block.

## Images

![walking]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/test.jpg)

## Writing code blocks

There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

```
.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.

```ruby
# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems through RubyGems
gem install jekyll bundler

# Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog
jekyll new myblog

# Change into your new directory
cd myblog

# Build the site on the preview server
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Now browse to http://localhost:4000
```

## Full HTML

Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:

<p><iframe style="width:100%;" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>


## Bundler

`gem install bundler` installs the bundler gem through RubyGems. You only need to install it once - not every time you create a new Jekyll project. Here are some additional details:

`bundler` is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires.

The `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` files inform `Bundler` about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesnâ€™t have these Gemfiles, you can omit `bundle exec` and just `run jekyll serve`.

When you run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, `Bundler` uses the gems and versions as specified in `Gemfile.lock` to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts.

For more information about how to use `Bundler` in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly.

## Jekyll

`jekyll new <PATH>` installs a new Jekyll site at the path specified (relative to current directory). In this case, Jekyll will be installed in a directory called `myblog`. Here are some additional details:

- To install the Jekyll site into the directory you're currently in, run `jekyll new` . If the existing directory isn't empty, you can pass the --force option with jekyll new . --force.
- `jekyll new` automatically initiates `bundle install` to install the dependencies required. (If you don't want Bundler to install the gems, use `jekyll new myblog --skip-bundle`.)
- By default, the Jekyll site installed by `jekyll new` uses a gem-based theme called Minima. With gem-based themes, some of the directories and files are stored in the theme-gem, hidden from your immediate view.
- We recommend setting up Jekyll with a gem-based theme but if you want to start with a blank slate, use `jekyll new myblog --blank`
- To learn about other parameters you can include with `jekyll new`, type `jekyll new --help`.
