## Overview
Here's what you're going to learn this lesson:
- the `<head>` tag, what it does, and what can go inside of it

---

## Challenge: View Page Source Code
Yes, we're going to start off with a challenge. 
Do you see this nice, white background to the left/right of this text?
Right click on it, and choose "View Page Source". 
If you don't see this option, make sure you're not right clicking on text, an image, etc.

If you did this correctly, you should see something like this.

This is actually the code for this lesson page! Don't worry if you don't understand most of it. 
As you learn more about HTML and practice building your own websites, it will all start to make sense.

Also, don't worry if it doesn't match exactly.

Now, your next task is to find the opening `<head>` and closing `</head>` tags.  
We're going to be looking at the code in between in more detail.

``` html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <link rel="icon" href="/assets/images/logo.png">

  <title>HTML Head | Philosocode</title>
      
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-MCw98/SFnGE8fJT3GXwEOngsV7Zt27NXFoaoApmYm81iuXoPkFOJwJ8ERdknLPMO" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.13/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-DNOHZ68U8hZfKXOrtjWvjxusGo9WQnrNx2sqG0tfsghAvtVlRW3tvkXWZh58N9jp" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Righteous%7CMerriweather:300,300i,400,400i,700,700i" rel="stylesheet">
  <link href="/assets/css/screen.css" rel="stylesheet">
  <link href="/assets/css/main.css" rel="stylesheet">
    
</head>
```

## What's The <head>?
The head contains "metadata" about the webpage.  
That's a fancy word that just means, "information about this page". For example:
- the page title
- the author
- the website's description
- CSS/JS files that are used
- the site icon
- and more...

The content between the `<head>` tags does not show up on the page.  
For example, this line of code from the example above:
```html
<meta charset="utf-8">
```
If you search for the text "utf-8" on this page, you won't find it.
That's because stuff in between the `<head></head>` doesn't show up on the page.
It just *describes* the page.


## What's IN The <head>?
There's a lot of stuff that can go in the `<head>`.
We're only going to cover the most important things that you will usually see.
Don't worry about memorizing all of this. If you ever forget, Google (or your favourite search engine) is just a few clicks away!

#### Title
```html
<title>My Webpage</title>
```
The title is the text that will appear in browser tabs, search engine results, and bookmarks.
![Page Source Code](title.jpg)

If you do a Google search, all those blue hyperlinks are actually website titles.

#### Charset
```html
<meta charset="utf-8">
```
Remember from last lesson that a tag can have this form:

```html
<tag-name attributeKey="attributeValue"></tag-name>
```

So here, `charset="utf-8"` is the attribute for the `<meta>` tag.
But what does it even mean?

`charset` means, "how is this document 'encoded'?" And `utf-8` is the "encoding method" used. 

For now, all you need to know is this: 
- UTF-8 contains characters from every human language. 
For example, look at [this site](https://mcdlr.com/utf-8/#1). All of those characters are in UTF-8... and there are a lot! 
- `charset="utf-8"` means you can use any language in your webpage. English, Korean (한국어), Japanese (日本語), Arabic (العَرَبِيَّة) etc, will all show up properly because of this `charset="utf-8"` attribute
- this is important because not everyone in the world uses English

#### Meta Tag
``` html
<meta name="author" content="Tam Le">
```
"author" is the author/creator of the webpage. And "content" holds the actual name of the author.

```html
<meta name="description" content="Description of this site">
```
This one is similar to the above. You use this to describe the webpage. For example:
```html
<meta name="description" content="The purpose of this webpage is to teach programming">
```

```html
<meta name="something" content="something">
```
The syntax (format, structure) can be a little confusing.  

The `name="something"` attribute is the type of information. For example, `name="author"` means this tag is about the author. `name="description"` means this tag is about the description for the website.

The `content="something"` attribute is the actual content/value. If `name="author"`, then `"content="author's name"`.
And if `name="description"`, then `content="description for the website goes here`

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
```
This meta tag is used for something called "responsive design" (we'll cover this later).
This tag sets the width of the webpage to the width of the device.
For example, if you have a reallllly wide monitor, the webpage's width will be that long.
Or if you're using a smartphone, the webpage's width will be the width of the smartphone.

#### Link
Link tags are used to link to other files. 
You'll usually use them for icons and CSS files.

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/assets/images/logo.png">
```
Just by reading this line of code, you should know what it does.  

The `rel="icon"` attribute means, "icon for the site".

`href` stands for "Hypertext REFerence", which just means, "link to another file".  
You will be seeing `href` again later when we cover hyperlinks.

The `href="/assets/images/logo.png"` attribute is the path to the favicon - where I put the icon.  
As you can see, it's in the "/assets/images" folder and called "logo.png" on my computer.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="my-css-file.css">
```
You use the `rel="stylesheet"` attribute to link to a CSS file.  
Like the above example, `href="my-css-file.css"` is the path to / location of the CSS file.  
We'll cover this in greater detail when we learn about CSS!

#### Script
```html
`<script src=“my-js-file.js”></script>`
```

The `<script>` tag is similar to `<link>`. However, it links to JavaScript files using the `src` attribute.  
We'll learn more about this element when we begin using JavaScript.

#### Mini-Challenge: Spot The Difference
Alright, time for another challenge.

What are 3 differences between the `<link>` and `<script>` tags?

{% capture text-capture %}
1. `<link>` has no closing tag (remember what these elements are called?). `<script>` has an opening and closing tag.
2. `<link>` has a `rel` attribute.
3. `<link>` uses `href` to link to CSS files. `<script>` uses `src` to link to JavaScript files.
{% endcapture %}

{% include toggle-field.html toggle-name="toggle-thats" button-text="View Answer" toggle-text=text-capture footer="&nbsp;" %}

## A Few More Tags...
Before we finish this lesson, I just want to cover a couple more important tags.  
These tags are not part of the head, but you will see them in every HTML document.

#### !DOCTYPE
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
This tag is the "document type declaration", or "DOCTYPE". 
For now, you just need to know 2 things:
- it means, "this document contains HTML"
- it always goes at the very top

```html
<html lang="en">
  <!-- Every other tag goes inside -->
</html>
```
Like the above, this tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document.  
This tag is the "root element". This means it wraps around - it contains - all the other tags, including `<head>` and `<body>`
As you can probably guess, the `lang="en"` attribute just means, "this document is in English".  
If your webpage is in a different language, you should change it (just Google "html lang iso codes").


## Where's The <head>?
#### Mini-Challenge: Where Does It Go?
Alright, final mini-challenge of the lesson: where do you put the `<head>`? Where should it go in the HTML?

If you need a hint, look at the code in the first mini-challenge at the top of the page ("View Page Source Code").

{% capture text-capture %}
The `<head>` comes after `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<html>`. We put it before `<body>`
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  <!-- Head stuff -->
  </head>
  <body>
  <!-- Body stuff -->
  </body>
</html>
```
{% endcapture %}

{% include toggle-field.html toggle-name="toggle-thats" button-text="View Answer" toggle-text=text-capture footer="&nbsp;" %}

## Summary
Here's what we covered this lesson:  
- viewing page source code: right click > "View Page Source"
- the head contains information about the page (title, author, icons, CSS/JS files, etc)
- the stuff in the head doesn't show up on the page
- `<meta charset="utf-8">`: we can use characters from different languages (English, French, Chinese, Arabic, etc)
- `<meta name="something" content="something">` are tags that describe the page
  + `<meta name="author" content="Joe">`
  + `<meta name="description" content="About this page">`
  + `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">`
- `<link>` tags can link to the site icon or CSS stylesheets
- `<script>` tags link to JavaScript files
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<html>`

This lesson was heavy on theory, but the upcoming lessons will be more practical and "hands-on". 
I've already said this a number of times, but don't worry about trying to memorize every little detail.  
This lesson was just to familiarize you with the `<head>` so when you start working on websites, the tags will be familiar.  
If you ever forget something, you can always refer back to this page or Google it!

If there was anything you didn't understand, need help with, or think I could explain better, please let me know!
I'll reply as soon as I can.

## Praxis
#### Challenge: Explain The Boilerplate
You've made it this far and now have all the knowledge needed to understand the "HTML Boilerplate".  
Here's your challenge: add comments above each line of code, explaining what it does.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
    <title>Title</title>
    <meta name="author" content="name">
    <meta name="description" content="description here">
    <meta name="keywords" content="keywords,here">
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=font1|font2|etc" type="text/css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css" type="text/css">
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
