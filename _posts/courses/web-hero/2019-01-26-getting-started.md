## My Goal
2 things I will strive to do:
  1. Create comprehensive lessons that are clear and easy-to-understand
  2. Teach you everything you need to know to start programming and build your own web-based projects.


## Setup
The first thing you'll need is a browser... Well, if you're reading this, I guess you already have that. If you don't have a preference, I would recommend using Google Chrome because it will make following along with the lessons easier. However, most modern browsers should be okay.

You'll also need a text editor (program to write code in). I would recommend getting "VS Code", which is awesome and free to use.
You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com) or by searching for it on Google. If you don't want to use VS Code, "Atom" (free) or "Sublime Text" are also great text editors.


## Course Format
Lessons on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be weaved throughout the course. Instead of completely studying HTML, then moving onto CSS, and so on, we'll be covering all three simultaneously. This approach will be more difficult and progress will be slower, but you will also learn more as a result (feel free to Google "interleaving" for more information).

As Confucius supposedly said, *"Knowledge without practice is useless"*. Some lessons will be theoretical. In others, we will be building projects together. 
Each lesson will come with practice questions and challenges, so there will plenty of chances to put what you learned into practice, 


## Let The Journey Begin
If there's anything you don't understand or anything you are struggling with, feel free to leave a comment. I promise I'll get back to you as soon as I can!

With that said, let's get started!
