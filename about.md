The goal of Philosocode.com is to provide the best tutorials related to programming and computer science.  
My mission is to create the clearest, easiest to understand, and most comprehensive lessons available on programming, computer science, and modern web development.

**Who Am I?**  
I'm a Computer Science student with a love for programming and teaching.
Although I'm not an expert and still have much to learn, I want to help people who want to learn to program, but have no clue where to begin, or don't believe that they can learn.
