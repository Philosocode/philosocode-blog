## Challenges
#### Attribute Investigate
Using Google and CodePen, create an `<img>` element that shows a picture from the Internet. 
The picture can be anything you like.

In Google Chrome, you can get an image URL in Google Images by right clicking on the image and  choosing "Copy Image Address". You should end up with something like this:

![Doggo](codepen-dog.jpg)

(HINT: if you need help, Google "MDN img" and read up on how to use the `<img>` tag)
